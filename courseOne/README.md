# A Primer in Command Line 
### Hello, there!
Welcome to a Primer in Command Line. In one, one hour class, I am going to walk you through what you need to start using your computer's command line. 
### What's Command Line?
Command Line is a way to enter commands to your computer using text instead of a graphical user interface. Sometimes command line is required to maintain code text, maintain servers, and download special coding packages. Command line can be faster, and it looks cool!  
In this class we'll be using BASH (the Born Again Shell). The linux way of using a terminal, and we'll do it so you can get started navigating your terminal on linux, a mac, or windows!
### To get started 
#### **Mac**: type `command + p` and up pops your terminal window! 
#### **Linux**: `ctrl + alt + k` 
### **Windows**: (A little trickier)
We'll first need to install [git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/). (Git is a amazing program to _source control code_)
Once downloaded, type the windows key and start typing `git bash`, you'll see the icon, click that and your good to go.
